**variable_structure_PID.mdl**

This simulink model is located under the directory 'files'.

This model is dependent on the following files that are located in the same folder:

-theta_input.m
-omega_input.m
-psi_input.m
-dynamics.m
-smc1.m

To run this model
- Open this file in any MATLAB version before 2019b (preferably 2018b) as this model extensively uses SIMSCAPE Multibody - V1 for the modeling aspect of the project.
- Add the path to the project in the MATLAB.
- After adding the relevant path, open this file in SIMULINK and run the model.
- The scope put to show error in joint angles, and torque will be generated.
